PROBLEMS:

SOLVED HARD PROBLEMS:
- Label doens't show complete text (Fixed using setTitle(xx) instead of title.text = xx)
- Code inside a alert view will run before alert view select.
- Color in label doesn't show: The reason is that the class ran before the array construction, so all the labels where nil because it had no text. Solved runing the algorithm inside the table construction.

TRY AGAIN LATER:
- Number of players, with setNeedsDisplay
